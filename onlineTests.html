<p><b>Creativity test results</b></p>

<p>Your creativity score is 58.01<br>Typical 63.34</p>

<h1>What these results mean</h1>
 <p>The test results indicate where I can improve in my daily life and in the workplace, participation and communication are key areas I need to improve, in a project that requires teamwork to succeed I may be lacking in communication skills needed, therefore I would not be able to contribute as much as I need and may not receive valuable feedback from my team as well as be able to provide feedback. If I was to work in a team environment I would need to work with a team who communicate effectively and confidently so I could see effective communication in use and learn from my peers.
