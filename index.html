<h1 style="text-align:center;">Interest in IT</h1>
<p>I have always been interested in IT, I guess it all started when I got an Atari from a second hand shop as a kid, not only did I love playing games but I also wondered how it was possible for plastic, metals and electricity to come together to create a visual and interactive experience that I enjoyed so much. When I got my hands on my first desktop pc (many years later) my curiosity about what’s going on inside that machine got even stronger.
I have no formal training in IT but as a hobby I regularly repair family and friend’s pc's and help solve software issue, also I have built a few gaming/emulation desktops and office computers for small businesses. 
I’m quite passionate about retro gaming and emulation, and would love to be a contributing part of the emulation community and help preserve and share what I consider pieces of art.
For the past 15 years I worked as fitter and turner in mining, manufacturing and tourism, unfortunately I injured myself and can longer work a physically demanding job. so I decided to try a career doing something I’m passionate about and enjoy. and that's how I found myself in this course

<p>My preferred learning style is Visual.<br>visual learners learn best when information is presented in a written language format or in another visual format such as pictures or diagrams. </p>

<p><b>Creativity test results</b></p>
<a href="http://www.testmycreativity.com/"> Link to creativity test</a>
<p>Your creativity score is 58.01<br>Typical 63.34</p>
<p>For me these test results indicate where I can improve in my daily life and in the workplace, participation and communication are key areas I need to improve, in a project that requires teamwork to succeed I may be lacking in communication skills needed, therefore I would not be able to contribute as much as I need and may not receive valuable feedback from my team as well as be able to provide feedback. If I was to work in a team environment I would need to work with a team who communicate effectively and confidently so I could see effective communication in use and learn from my peers.</p>

 <h1 style="text-align:center;">Project idea</h1>
<p>Haven’t caught a feed in years? Want to catch that big fish? If only you could see whats going on under that water ……we aim to deliver a user friendly seafloor map application that can be easily used by anglers, boaters, explorers and anyone interested in what’s laying beneath the water. With this app installed on a device the user can see in real time the bottom of the seafloor using augmented reality to produce a 3d image of the seafloor.</p>
<p>In Australia up to 5 million aussies enjoy wetting a line as a hobby annually, not to mention our thriving seafood market which is worth billions annually, we are a nation who lives by the sea and also needs the sea to live. This app has a huge market of consumers who would love to get their hands on it. Due to the major advantage any fisherperson has by using this app I believe it will be released as a paid app </p>
<p>The seafloor map app combines several technologies to create a unique mapping process and user friendly map, first of all we had to scan the sea bed using 3D environment laser scanning which also stores location information, this data stored on our servers, our database constantly growing and hope to ultimately map the entire ocean floor. We have implemented augmented reality in to the seafloor map app, simply open the seafloor map app point your camera of the device at the body of water you would like to map and it will show a 3d image of the sea bed from where the user stands.</p>
<p>Seafloor map app will be available on ios and android, all you need is a compatible device and the app installed and you can unlock the gift of seeing through water. Seafloor map app has an in build social area where users can share and find fishing spots and 24/7 online support. </p>
<p>To achieve all this, we need to obtain vessels that can mount the 3d environment laser scanner and start scanning the sea floor to begin our database of maps, this is a never-ending process as the sea floor changes it will be difficult to keep maps up to date but with enough vessels we can keep our database updated regularly. Once we have a decent database of maps we need to write the software and test.</p>
<p>If this product is successful I expect to see people catching a lot more fish, if this is the case we could possibly have a problem with fish numbers lowering and possible extinction of our favourite fish species. On the plus side this would show that this product works.</p>
