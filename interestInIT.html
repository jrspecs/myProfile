  <h1>Interest In IT</h1>
  <p>I have always been interested in IT, I guess it all started when I got an Atari from a second hand shop as a kid, not only did I love playing games but I also wondered how it was possible for plastic, metals and electricity to come together to create a visual and interactive experience that I enjoyed so much. When I got my hands on my first desktop pc (many years later) my curiosity about what’s going on inside that machine got even stronger.</p>
  <p>I have no formal training in IT but as a hobby I regularly repair family and friend’s pc's and help solve software issue, I have built a few gaming/emulation desktops and office computers for small businesses. I’m quite passionate about retro gaming and emulation, and would love to be a contributing part of the emulation community and help preserve and share what I consider pieces of art.</p>
  <p>For the past 15 years I worked as fitter and turner in mining, manufacturing and tourism, unfortunately I injured myself and can longer work a physically demanding job. so I decided to try a career doing something I’m passionate about and enjoy. and that's how I found myself in this course .</p>
